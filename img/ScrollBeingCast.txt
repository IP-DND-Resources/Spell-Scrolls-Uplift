Dalle-3: A watercolor painting on textured paper showcases an ancient parchment scroll, unfurled diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right, its worn edges curled and frayed. The scroll glows with turquoise light radiating from intricate arcane symbols forming a central sun-like design, set against a dark, atmospheric backdrop of swirling earth tones, the light's soft diffusion contrasting with the scrollâ€™s rich texture.
