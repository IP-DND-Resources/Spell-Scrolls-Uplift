Dalle-3: A watercolor and ink illustration captures a scribe, hunched over a scroll at a dimly lit desk, surrounded by ancient runes and a soft, golden glow from an oil lamp. The room is filled with aged books, scrolls, and writing tools, while textured walls and warm, sepia tones evoke a sense of history and depth, focusing on the scribe and the lamp in sharp detail against the blurred backdrop.
