# Spell Scrolls
Spell scrolls are a largely ignored, underwhelming, and often a trivialized part of D&D. This isn't very suprising given the restrictions in use and narrow situations where they can even be useful, assuming your DM even makes them available. The most restrictive aspect of Spell Scrolls is the requirement for them to be on your class's spell list. Many DMs use a homebrew rule that says "anyone can attempt to use any spell scroll" as a down and dirty way to make them not useless. This homebrew aims to add some mechanics that make Spells Scrolls an interesting mechanical choice and part of a character's background.

## Origin: Scrivener
Your hands ache, covered with callouses after the countless hours you've spent copying and scribing Spell Scrolls for those that employed you. Perhaps this was at the College of Mages, an arcane merchant shop, an underground forgery syndicate, or for a family member who studied the arcane arts. You have learned how to add the pure essence of arcanum to various medium, and how to scribe spells with speed and efficiency.

**Ability Scores:** Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom

**Feat:** Apprentence Scrivener

## Origin Feat
### Apprentence Scrivener

*Origin Feat*

You gain the following benefits.

**Scrivening.** Your years of experience as a scrivener allow you to scribe Spell Scrolls more efficiently. Your level 1+ spells are considered 1 level lower for the purposes of determining their crafting time and cost requirements.

**Quick Scribe.** Instead of scribing a spell to a scroll, you can designate any Book or Shield as your Scribe Media. You can scribe spells to your Scribe Media and it can hold a number of scribed spells equal to your proficiency bonus. Spells scribed to your Scribe Media disappear once used. Twice per day, you can spend 10 minutes to scribe a spell from the Quick Scribe table to your Scribe Media. When you designate a new Book or Shield as your Scribe Media, your scribed spells fade from the old Scribe Media and are lost. Only you can decipher the spells on your Scribe Media, and you can read and cast spells from your Scribe Media reliably.

#### Quick Scribe Spells
|Spell|Level|School|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Blade Ward|0|Abjuration|
|Guidance|0|Divination|
|Resistance|0|Abjuration|
|Detect Magic|1|Divination|
|Expeditious Retreat|1|Transmutation|
|Fog Cloud|1|Conjuration|

## General Feats
### Magineer

*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)*

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Magical Fluency.** You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is not on your class list or not of a level you can normally cast, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a successful check you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

**Adept Execution.** You have Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to cast spells from Spell Scrolls.

**Partial Reading.** When a Spell Scroll you use would disintegrate, roll 1d12. On a roll of 12, the scroll does not disintegrate.

## FAQ
#### What Spell Save DC and Spell Attack should I use?
**RAW:** Spell Scrolls use a static Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Bonus

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the following table.
}}

|Spell Level|Rarity|Save DC|Attack Bonus|
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Cantrip|Common		|13|+5|
|1		|Common		  |13|+5|
|2		|Uncommon	  |13|+5|
|3		|Uncommon	  |15|+7|
|4		|Rare		    |15|+7|
|5		|Rare		    |17|+9|
|6		|Very Rare	|17|+9|
|7		|Very Rare	|18|+10|
|8		|Very Rare	|18|+10|
|9		|Legendary	|19|+11|

#### Can spells cast from Spell Scrolls be countered?
This is hotly contested, split on the following questions: Do spells cast from Spell Scrolls still require you to perform the Verbal or Somatic components for the spell? Is the reading of a Spell Scroll considered a Verbal or Somatic component. For now, this is best left up to your DM unless I missed some concrete ruling.

#### When I cast a Cantrip Spell Scroll, do I benefit from level scaling?
Yes, When casting a Cantrip (Level 0) from a Spell Scroll, the Cantrip scales appropriately with your character level.

For example, If you are character level 5, a Spell Scroll insribed with Chill Touch, would roll 2d10 for damage.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 233; Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.
}}


#### How is a Spell with Concentration or Ritual handled?
Pretty much the same as a spell being cast with a spell slot, with the scroll being an analog for the spell slot.

##### Concentration
When a spell with concentration is cast from a Spell Scroll, it functions identially as if the spell was cast by any other means. The caster must maintain Concentration, or the spell effect ends early. The Spell Scroll is consumed once the spell casting is complete.

##### Ritual
When a spell with the Ritual tag is cast from a Spell Scroll, it functions similarly as if the spell was cast by any other means. The caster must maintain concentration for the duration of the casting. Similarly to the loss of a spell slot, the Spell Scroll is **not** consumed until the casting is complete. Spell Scrolls are consumed either at the completion of casting or the failure to pass a required ability check.

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost
}}

Spell Scrolls can be effectively thought of as a physical spell slot.
