# Scrivener
Spell scrolls are a largely ignored, underwhelming, and often a trivialized part of D&D. This isn't very suprising given the restrictions in use and narrow situations where they can even be useful, assuming your DM even makes them available. The most restrictive aspect of Spell Scrolls is the requirement for them to be on your class's spell list. Many DMs use a homebrew rule that says "anyone can attempt to use any spell scroll" as a down and dirty way to make them not useless. This homebrew aims to add some proper mechanics that make Spells Scrolls an interesting mechanical choice and part of a character's background. It enables progression by offering exclusive general feats that build off of the origin feat, without locking the best parts behind it. These feats are largely aimed at "gish" style characters, but also offer something for pure martial or spell caster classes too.

## Origin: Scrivener
Your hands ache, covered with callouses after the countless hours you've spent copying and scribing Spell Scrolls for those that employed you. Perhaps this was at the College of Mages, an arcane merchant shop, an underground forgery syndicate, or for a family member who studied the arcane arts. You have learned how to add the pure essence of arcanum to parchment, and how to utilize these instruments to their fullest potential.

**Ability Scores:** Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom

**Feat:** Apprentence Scrivener

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana and Sleight of Hand

**Tool Proficiency:** Calligrapher's Supplies

**Equipment:** *Choose* A or B: (A) Calligrapher's Supplies, Map or Scroll Case, Pouch, Ink (4 bottles), Ink Pen, Parchment (10 Sheets), Lamp, Oil (2 Flasks), Traveler's Clothes, 4 GP; or (B) 50 GP

## Origin Feat
### Apprentence Scrivener

*Origin Feat*

You gain the following benefits.

**Scribe Points.** You have a number of Scribe Points equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain your expended Scribe Points when you finish a Long Rest.

**Scrivening.** Drawing from your experience as a Scrivener, you can use and scribe Spell Scrolls from the Scrivener spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for Spell Scrolls scribed by this feat (choose when you select this feat).

**Quick Scribe.** You can scribe a Spell Scroll in 10 minutes by spending a number of a Scribe Points equal to 1 plus the level of the spell. Instead of the normal crafting costs, the scribing of this Spell Scroll consumes one sheet of parchment and ink worth a total value of 5 GP plus 5 GP for each level of the spell, in addition to any materials required by the spell. This Spell Scroll has no value and is unintelligible to anyone other than you. When the total number of scrolls created with this benefit exceeds your spellcasting ability modifier chosen for this feat, the magic from one of the other scrolls randomly fades away and disappears.

**Organized.** When you take the Magic Action to use a Spell Scroll, as a part of that action you can retrieve a Spell Scroll from a Pouch or a Map or Scroll Case. A Pouch is able to hold up to a total of 6 Spell Scrolls and a Map or Scroll Case can hold up to 5 Spell Scolls.

## FAQ

### Spell Scrolls
##### Spell Source: Class (and Subclass) Spell List (Multiclass)

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 228; Spell Scroll

If the spell is on your class's spell list [...].
}}

This does extend to "Subclass" in the case of Arcane Trickster or Eldritch Knight by way of the Spellcasting feature giving them access to the Wizard spell list.

This feature **does not limit** the typical use of Spell Scrolls from your class, subclass, or multiclass spell list using the normal casting rules.


\column

##### Spell Source: Magic Initiate (Feat)
This feat teaches you spells and adds them to your prepared spell list. These spells are considered to be known outside of what is considered *your* "spell list" (even though you select the spell *from* a specific class list).

[Discussion Thread](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/132036/does-learning-a-spell-through-the-magic-initiate-feat-allow-me-to-cast-that-spel)

**RAW:** This feat **doesn't** allow the use of Spell Scrolls.


##### Spell Source: Racial/Species
Similar to Magic Initiate (Feat), the spell learned in this manner, even though it is *prepared*, is not specifically associated with a spell list *you* have.

**RAW:** This feature **doesn't** allow the use of Spell Scrolls.

##### Spell Source: Subclass feature
Various Subclass', such as Celestial Patron (Warlock), or Fey Wanderer (Ranger), give you access to additional spells via their features. 2024 updated the rules around what is considered to be on your class spell list.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 236; Class Spell Lists

[...] Some features add a spell to a character’s spell list [...].
}}

This feature **does not limit** the the use of Spell Scrolls.

#### What Spell Save DC and Spell Attack should I use?
**RAW:** All Spell Scrolls use a static Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Bonus

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the following table.
}}

|Spell Level|Rarity|Save DC|Attack Bonus|
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Cantrip|Common		|13|+5|
|1		|Common		  |13|+5|
|2		|Uncommon	  |13|+5|
|3		|Uncommon	  |15|+7|
|4		|Rare		    |15|+7|
|5		|Rare		    |17|+9|
|6		|Very Rare	|17|+9|
|7		|Very Rare	|18|+10|
|8		|Very Rare	|18|+10|
|9		|Legendary	|19|+11|

#### Can spells cast from Spell Scrolls be countered?
This is hotly contested, split on the following questions: Do spells cast from Spell Scrolls still require you to perform the Verbal or Somatic components for the spell? Is the reading of a Spell Scroll considered a Verbal or Somatic component. For now, this is best left up to your DM unless I missed some concrete ruling.

</div>

#### When I cast a Cantrip Spell Scroll, do I benefit from level scaling?
Yes, When casting a Cantrip (Level 0) from a Spell Scroll, the Cantrip scales appropriately with your character level.

For example, If you are character level 5, a Spell Scroll insribed with Chill Touch, would roll 2d10 for damage.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 233; Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.
}}


#### How is a Spell with Concentration or Ritual handled?
Pretty much the same as a spell being cast with a spell slot, with the scroll being an analog for the spell slot.

##### Concentration
When a spell with concentration is cast from a Spell Scroll, it functions identially as if the spell was cast by any other means. The caster must maintain Concentration, or the spell effect ends early. The Spell Scroll is consumed once the spell casting is complete.

##### Ritual
When a spell with the Ritual tag is cast from a Spell Scroll, it functions similarly as if the spell was cast by any other means. The caster must maintain concentration for the duration of the casting. Similarly to the loss of a spell slot, the Spell Scroll is **not** consumed until the casting is complete. Spell Scrolls are consumed either at the completion of casting or the failure to pass a required ability check.

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost
}}

Spell Scrolls can be effectively thought of as a physical spell slot.

### Apprentence Scrivener
#### Scrivening
##### Can I use the spells on this list with spell slots I have from other features?
No, you cannot. These spells are not able to be prepared, only scribed to a Spell Scroll. They are organized in a "spell list" to better align to existing rules and simplify wording.

#### Quick Scribe
##### How long do these Scrolls last?
They have no specific expiration. You can store up a limited collection of them if you wish, up to your spell casting modifier that you chose with the feat. Any more than that, you randomly lose one.

##### If a bottle of ink is worth 10 GP, is the whole bottle consumed for one Cantrip scroll?
No, you only consume 5 GP worth of that ink. 1 bottle of ink (10 GP) has enough ink for 2 Cantrip scrolls scribed this way.

##### How many Scribe Points are required to scribe a Cantrip?
1 Point. Cantips are level 0, so they would require 1 plus 0 points.

##### How do I randomly decide the scroll that I lose when I have too many?
Typically you can just do a dice roll, and assign 1 face to each scroll. if there are too many faces, they are just a reroll. Even/Odd is prefect when you can only have a max of 2.


##### Can I scribe a spell learned by a racial feat or some other source?
No, the requirement is that the spell is on your "spell list".

#### Organized
##### Why does this mention that you can retreive the scroll as part of the Magic action, can't you do that anyway?
Yes! Also no!

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 24; Interacting with Things.

You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action. [...] If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the Utilize action. [...]
}}

This is typically interpreted to mean that if something is freely accessible (in a pouch or on your person) you can access it as part of the action you take to use it (Drink a potion, attack with a weapon). If it is not freely accessible (in a backpack) you need to take the Utilize action to access it. If you combine multiple benefits and features and have to opportunity to retreive and use two Spell Scrolls in one turn, RAW would suggest that you cannot access the second scroll unless it was already in your hand without a utilize action.

This benefit effectively turns pouches and scroll cases into pseudo-quivers for scrolls, allowing you to quickly access any scroll within them. Quantity limits are established to ensure this isn't abused. If your DM allows you to equip multiple pouches or scroll cases, that is their choice. This is added mostly to give some clarity to players and DMs on how this is all intended to work.

{{pageNumber 4}}
{{footnote PART 3 | FAQ}}

\page

##### I think a Pouch should be able to hold X, why was 6 chosen?
A Pouch has 1/5th cubic feet (345 inches cubed) of space. A 2" cylinder that is 12" long (A rolled up parchment scroll of 18" long by 12" wide) is about 56.55 inches cubed. This works out nicely when considering weight to volume ratios for Pouch contents (if your group uses this). If a Pouch can carry .2 cubic feet or 6 lbs, this means you could carry 2 Potions of Healing (.5 lbs ea), 2 lbs of Rations, and 3 Spell Scrolls. All of this is of course up to DM discretion and open to intepretation. A Map or Scroll Case can carry (RAW) 5 sheets of parchment, so about 5 Spell Scrolls.

### Journeyman Scrivener
##### Do I also get the Ability Score Increase from the chosen feat?
Yes.

### Master Scrivener
#### Arcane Forgery
##### Can I combine this benefit with Quick Scribe to make a copy of a Spell Scroll I have?
As long as it is on your spell list, yes! The intent is to reward a heavy investment into the Scrivener origin. You have now spent your Origin feat and 2 ASI feats to get here. That gives up a lot of potential offensive and defensive capabilities, so the idea is to reward it with flexibility.

##### How is this considered good?
Combining it with the benefit of Quick Scribe or the standard crafting rules, you can do the following:

- Assuming you took Magineer at some point, you can have a collection of spell scrolls that you can make quick copies of each day.
- You can quickly create Spell Scrolls from spells on your spell list that you dont have normally have prepared incase you need a one off use.
- You can make proper copies of a Spell Scroll (using normal crafting mechanics) for your allies to use.

This enables some really interesting flexibility options for any class / playstyle. 

### Magineer
#### Magical Fluency
##### If I have Spellcasting (Sorcerer) and I also take this feat, what ability check do I make when using a Spell Scroll?

If the spell is on the Sorcerer class list: Charisma. If it is not: The spellcasting ability selected when you chose this feat. (Probably also Charisma, right?)

\column

##### Do I still need to pass an ability check when using Spell Scrolls via this benefit?
{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus the spell's level.
}}

This benefit removes the restriction "on your spell list" but does not change "of a higher level than you can normally cast". If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, you can reliably cast spells from a spell scroll of a level that you can normally cast with that feature.

**Example 1:** A level 5 Sorcerer gains access to level 3 spells, and with this feat could now reliably cast any level 3 (or lower) spell scroll. If the Sorcerer attempts to use a level 4 Spell Scroll (from any spell list), they would perform an ability check with the DC set to 14.

**Example 2:** A level 7 Barbarian has no Spellcasting features, so they are unable to cast even a level 0 spell (cantrip). If they attempt to use a level 0 Spell Scroll (Cantrip), they would perform an ability check  with the DC set to 10.

This is pretty similar to the level 13 feature for the Rogue subclass, Thief. The wording in this feature makes more sense with this above context. (Note: The Thief gets to use an Arcana check as part of the feature, instead of straight ability check).

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 137; Use Magic Device (Scrolls)

You can use any Spell Scroll, [...] If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

#### Keen Execution
##### How does this benefit interact with the Rogue feature Cunning Action?
{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 130; Cunning Action

[...] On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage,
or Hide.
}}

If the rogue chooses to Dash or Disengage as a Bonus Action it would technically trigger this benefit, but the Rogue has already used their Bonus Action for the turn.

This benefit is meant to be in line power wise with feats like Dual Wielder, Great Weapon Master, etc where you get to do an extra action as a Bonus Action, but it doesn't give you an additional Bonus Action to do so. This effectively lets you Dash or Disengage as a Bonus Action if you only cast a Cantrip or a Level 1 or less Spell Scroll, it just makes the wording less confusing. If some feature or benefit lets you make a specially timed Dash or Disengage that doesn't consume your Bonus Action or Action, then that action economy is likely already balanced accordingly.

### Echomancer
#### Memorize
##### If I scribe a Spell Scroll from my spell list, cast and memorize it, do I just have it permanently prepared?
In effect, yes. This assumes you dont replace it with another memorized spell later. You even get a few free uses with the Reptition benefit!

##### Why level 3, what about X situation?
Level 3 starts to bring some pretty awesome and iconic spells. Considering it requires a Spell Scroll that you can cast, you have already either:

- Invested into the Magineer feat and are currently level 8+.
- Have the spell on your class list and have access to it already.
- Were given the scroll by your DM

Until you get to level 17, you can only cast this for free once, otherwise you have to consume spell slots (if you have them). Outside of that, access to extra level 2 and less spells aren't going to be game breaking.

#### Repetition
##### What if I memorize a level 3 spell when my Proficiency Bonus is only 2?
Then you wouldn't be able to cast it using this benefit until level 5.

##### If I memorize a level 1 spell and use up all my Repetition points, can I still cast the spell with spell slots?
Yes! You have the spell prepared. Same logic is why you can cast a memorized Cantrip for free (because you know the memorized spell). 

### Luminary
#### Get What You Give
##### Does this trigger from a level 1 spell cast from any item?
Yes! For example, if you have an Enspelled Armor with a level 1 spell, and you take the Magic action to cast the spell, this benefit would be triggered. The reason it is worded "from a magic item or any level 1 or less spell [...]" is because the intent is to have this be primarily a bonus of using Spell Scrolls, without making it a dead benefit just because you dont have or use them.

#### Inspiring Words
##### Who rolls the bonus die?
The character that has the benefit. It is intended (thematically) to represent the effectiveness of your inspiring words.
